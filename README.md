# Todo Application

## Overview
The Simple ToDo Application is a basic task management system developed using the Spring Boot framework, powered by Java. It provides a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting ToDo items. This project is designed as a simple demonstration of how to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with Spring Boot, focusing on the core concepts of web application development.

## Key Components
<li> Framework: The application is built on the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development of Java-based web applications. Spring Boot provides features for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

<li> Programming Language: The primary programming language used in this project is Java.

<li> Controller: The application's controller class provides a set of RESTful endpoints to interact with ToDo items. These endpoints enable tasks like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.

<li> Entity (ToDo Item): The todoapp class defines the data model for ToDo items. It includes fields for a unique identifier, task name, and completion status.

<li> Database Design (In-memory): For simplicity, the project uses an in-memory data store, implemented as a Spring Bean. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by a relational database. The database schema could include fields for item ID, task name, and completion status.

## Data Structure
The application manages ToDo items in a collection data structure (e.g., a list or array). In a production environment, this data structure would be replaced by a database.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started with the Simple ToDo Application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

<li>Programming Language: Knowledge of Java.
<li>Development Tools: Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven for building and running the project.
<li>API Client: A REST API client (e.g., Postman or cURL) for interacting with the API.
  
## Usage
You can use this project as a starting point to learn Spring Boot, practice building RESTful APIs, or as a foundation for more complex task management applications. Customize and expand upon the codebase to suit your specific requirements.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by opening issues, providing feedback, or submitting pull requests to enhance the application or address issues.

## Project Status
This project is a basic implementation of a ToDo application. It is intended for educational and learning purposes and can serve as a foundation for more feature-rich task management systems.

This updated project summary specifies that the Simple ToDo Application is developed using the Spring Boot framework and is primarily written in the Java programming language. It provides additional information about the technology stack used in the project.
